# Online Steam — Check if a Game is Alive

Online Steam is a simple app that helps you check how many players are currently online in any Steam game.

Originally started as an Android app, the project has shifted towards a desktop-first direction using the Textual framework (Python).

## Features

- Search for any Steam game by name
- Get the correct AppID and current live player count
- Runs locally, no login required
- EXE build for easy use on Windows

## Why this app?

SteamDB provides this info, but it's not always fast or user-friendly.  
Online Steam simplifies that: type the game name, get the result immediately — without digging through a website.

This tool is useful for checking if a game is active before launching or buying it.
